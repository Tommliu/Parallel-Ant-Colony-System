15618 Final Project (Parallel Ant Colony System)

## SUMMRY
Summarize your project in no more than 2-3 sentences. Describe what you plan
to do and what parallel systems you will be working with. Example one-liners include (you
should add a bit more detail)


## BACKGROUND
If your project involves accelerating a compute-intensive application, describe the application or piece of the application you are going to implement in more
detail. This description need only be a few paragraphs. It might be helpful to include a
block diagram or pseudocode of the basic idea. An important detail is what aspects of the
problem might benefit from parallelism and why?

## CHALLENGE 
Describe why the problem is challenging. What aspects of the problem
might make it difficult to parallelize? In other words, what to you hope to learn by doing
the project?

## RESOURCES
Describe the resources (type of computers, starter code, etc.) you will use.
What code base will you start from? Are you starting from scratch or using an existing
piece of code? Is there a book or paper that you are using as a reference (if so, provide a
citation)? Are there any other resources you need, but havenâ€™t figured out how to obtain
yet? Could you benefit from access to any special machines?

## GOALS AND DELIVERABLES
Describe the deliverables or goals of your project

## PLATFORM CHOICE
Describe why the platform (computer and/or language) you have
chosen is a good one for your needs. Why does it make sense to use this parallel system
for the workload you have chosen?
